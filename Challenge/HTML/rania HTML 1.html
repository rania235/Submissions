      Self-confidence typically refers to general self-confidence. This is
      different from self-efficacy, which psychologist Albert Bandura has
      defined as a “belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or
      accomplish a task” and therefore is the term that more accurately refers
      to specific self-confidence.
